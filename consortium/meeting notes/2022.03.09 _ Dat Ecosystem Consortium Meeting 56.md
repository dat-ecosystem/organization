## NOTES

### 0. who would take notes today
serapath

### 1. Checking in
**diego**:
* last couple of week they were working hard on [`SHER`](https://sher.app) which is one month live now
* working on features
* adding options to download recordings so people can replay or move it to other platforms
* trying to connect with new creators
* preparing another pitch desk for investors

**ninabreznik**
* pushing forward on datdot, working on datdot UI
* previous designer left the team
* we have a new designer, mimi
* working on communication between ui components to make app work

**serapath**
* also working on datdot
* review onboarding of the new designer
* working on blockchain/frontend integration + hyper side of things
* taking some time to integrate hyper relay part
* 

**kevin**
* ara closed a round of finance
* we've been doing contracting with blade firm. Work around nfts for rad. 
  * https://app.rad.live/
* blade firm is based on ukraine
* we should have a technical call after this or any other consortium call about hyper browser bridge (ara is also working or this/having similar problems when onboarding)


### 2. previous action items
- work on new doc summarizing multi-sig wallet and DAO experience https://hackmd.io/M1i1NiNLSR6upzGRf5Subg

* kevin would share how to use multisig wallets
* nina: how could we move funds and co-govern them
  * idea to move them to open collective would need to exchange into USD
    * while crypto is low
  * another idea was to claim and exchange them into ether to put them
    * into a ethereum based multisig wallet
    * so all consortium members need to confirm any transactions
  * how does it work? => @kevin
* kevin: if we choose to convert handshake tokens into eth indirectly
  * do we know how we do that? would we use an exchange?
* nina: joe hand should know, he claimed tokens already
  * also the first dat-data.com website ever had a bitcoin donation address
  * so maybe joe could exchange them into bitcoin and from there to ethereum
* kevin: is the symbol HNS?
* serapath: i think yes
* kevin: it seems to be on bitrex with the symbol HNS
* nina: coinmarketcap has HNS tokens listed
  * https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/handshake/
* kevin: it is 0.1888 dollar cents
* kevin: i am on a bunch of crypto exchanges personally but they only
  * let you trade ethereum and bitcoin
  * unless you give them your passport and other stuff
  * but kevin is set up with that for certain crypto currencies
  * binance is chinese and kevin is registered there too but without passport
* nina: using kraken but they dont have handshake tokens
* kevin: ara is erc20 so thats easier
* kevin: but going between chains needs centralized exchanges
  * and they want your passport
* kevin: looks like HNS prices are coming from bitrex
  * https://bittrex.com/discover/coins/ticker/hns
* kevin: its difficult to do something if not an organisation joins the exchange
  * it requires legal work to provide some documents
  * its harder when we need to set up an organisation for this purpose
* nina: maybe if open collective could swap it for us
* kevin: maybe bitrex user outside of the USA might be able to do it
* kevin: we could use gnosis multisig wallet which is the leading ethereum multisig wallet to do it
* nina: joe said
  > We're happy to facilitate this and add the funds to the Open Collective (I think we'd have to convert to USD but could discuss alternatives). I know I claimed mine from my Github ssh key portion but didn't realize they had them for domains as well. It wasn't readily apparent to me on how to do it for domains.
  > Let us know how we can help here. 
* nina: so he has experience and might be open to alternatives
* kevin: (gives presentation about multisig wallets with shared screen)

### 3. learn how to use a multisig wallet

### 4. handshake grant

some discussion between meetings

## Action Items
1. we continue about discussion next time with the goal to find the multisig wallet system which mimics the rules of the dat-ecosystem (consortium + manifesto, ...)
2. discuss if we add a grant/bounty for developing the custom multisig system (e.g. joe werle?)
3. create a short screencast tutorial to setup metamask and the multisig wallet using a testnet so everyone can walk through
   * result is a 8/8 testnet multisig proposal goes through before the next consoritum meeting
4. claim handhshake funds in cooperation with joe hand
  1. claim tokens
  2. exchange tokens
  3. store tokens in a multisig
