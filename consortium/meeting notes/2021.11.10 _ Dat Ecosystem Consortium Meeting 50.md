### Transition to Open Collective & Grant

Nina: funds are transferred to the Open Collective. Once we finish the tasks, we make a report to the CS&S. And if we don't manage to execute all the tasks, we should return the amount for that task.

Serapath: Tasks are split into 3 batches: 
- yellow label for all tasks that belong to the grant
- red, blue and green tasks: https://github.com/dat-ecosystem/organization/issues
- red: finished by Mid December
- blue: Mid Dec - End of January (20 Jan)
- green: 20 Jan - end of Feb

Take a look and see in which batch is your task and please feel free to ask for more instructions or any additional info.

### Technical discussion

**Replication question**

Serapath:
Can a peer replicate feed with same key through same peer connection with same keypair or would it need to create a new keypair and connect on a topic again with that new keypair?

Paul:
Yes, that would probably be needed.

**Autobase**

Serapath:
Can you give access to the values of selected keys in a hyperbee?

Paul:
You could create a subbee for certain keys and then give access using Noise key to those (you would basically mount the bees under the main bee)
