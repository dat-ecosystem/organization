#### HANDSHAKE GRANT & MULTISIG

- **Kevin demo-ed a multisig system they are using at Ara (Gnosis)**
    - pros: 
        - easy to use, 
        - easy to manage, 
        - ready to use, 
        - free
    - cons: 
        - it is based on ethereum (so all handshake tokens have to be first exchanged in ethers and then our funds would be in ethers)
        - it doesn't 100% reflect our manifesto
            - in the multisig system we could set up to confirm the proposal (i.e. expense) with 100% of the votes (but that would mean we can only execute the expense if all the members sign (=vote). In practise we now have the consortium system where proposal passes if no one objects it. With having a 100% of the members confirmation system, we could be blocked if one or more members don't vote


- **another problem we figured out while discussing this topic:**
    - in Open Collective there is a system where only one member can approve the expense (no voting needed, which also doesn't reflect the manifesto rules)
        - BUT Open Collective is a centralizied app and if one member abuses the power, we as consoritum can reach out to Open Collecitve and ask to revert the approval

- **we could make a custom multisig based on Gnosis**
    - Joe Werle can build this (we could bounty that task and get it done)

#### PROPOSAL
