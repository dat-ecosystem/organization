## Consortium

#### Role of the Consortium

- discussions on **interoperability standards**
- **collective fundraising/crowdfunding** (e.g. for events, onboarding, docs, website...)
- **managing community resources** - funds, brand/logo/name/IP, twitter/github profiles, irc/gitter/discord, mailing list, website, repositories, blog
- **invite only** (if no member objects - 100% consensus)
- based on the Manifesto and the Code of conduct (breaking the CoC or Manifesto can be reason to be expelled)

#### Meetings

* regular schedule (every two weeks)
* meetings are open, anyone can join and participate, but only consortium members vote
* [notes](https://hackmd.io/@T6Wf5EsOQKe-6wyPjJPtuw/Hycn0F63r/%2FHbu0ffkwQS6KIO_97fH-Mw)

#### Short term working plan

- rules for managing funds and other prev Dat foundation assets


#### Longer term plans

-  events
-  bounties for % of the funds
-  fundraising for a certain goal
-  co-funding work all of our projects need
