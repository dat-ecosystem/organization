# MANIFESTO

We, the "Dat Ecosystem" members, come together to achieve the following goals:

- Share our knowledge on building decentralized systems.
- Publish our work under permissive, open culture, licenses.
- Build decentralized systems that profit the general public.
- Have the [hypercore-protocol][1] as a foundation of our work.
- Promote our shared goals with the public.
- Develop solutions to shared technical problems.
- Find and invite new members that share our goals.
- Promote the adoption of shared technology through documentation or standardization.

This group is **governed by individuals** that form together _"the Consortium"_. The Consortium works to:

- Enact our [code of conduct](./code-of-conduct.md).
- Raise and maintain funds and assets to fulfill the goals.
- Use decentralized systems wherever feasible.
- Publicly and transparently document the process and offer the public a means to comment.
- Coordinate efforts by members.

Decisions will be done through votes at our meetings. The voting items need to be shared at least 48 hours in advance with all consortium members. Regular voting items are accepted unless there is opposition by at least one Consortium member. Members may state opposition beforehands.

The addition of a member or changes to this Manifesto requires unanimous support by all Consortium members. The removal of one member requires unanimous support by all Consortium members except by the member in question. Members can remove themselves at any given time.
