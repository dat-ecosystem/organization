# MANIFESTO

We, the "Dat Ecosystem" members, come together to achieve the following goals:

- Share our knowledge on building decentralized systems.
- Publish our work under permissive, open culture, licenses.
- Build decentralized systems that profit the general public and empower users.
- Have dat protocols (e.g. [hypercore-protocol][1] or similar) as a foundation of our work.
- Promote our shared goals with the public.
- Develop solutions to shared technical problems.
- Find and invite new members that share our goals.
- Promote the adoption of shared technology through documentation or standardization.

This group is **governed by individuals** that form together _"the Consortium"_. The Consortium works to:

- Enact our [code of conduct](./code-of-conduct.md).
- Raise and maintain funds and assets to fulfill the goals.
- Use decentralized systems wherever feasible.
- Publicly and transparently document the process and offer the public a means to comment.
- Coordinate efforts by members.
- Communicate on [discord/cabal](https://github.com/dat-ecosystem/dat-ecosystem.github.io#join-the-dat-ecosystem-chat-network)

Proposals are submitted as pull requests to `/consortium/decisions/${YYY}.${MM}.${DD}-${proposal_name}.md` in this repository.  
Proposals to change the manifesto are submitted as pull requests to change the manifesto itself.
Proposer needs to tag all consortium members in the pull request and notify consortium members in the active consortium communication channel.

Decisions will be done through voting by consortium members. The voting period lasts 2 weeks.  
Regular voting items are accepted unless there is opposition by at least one Consortium member. Members may state opposition beforehands.

The addition of a member or changes to this Manifesto requires unanimous support by all Consortium members.  
The removal of one member requires unanimous support by all Consortium members except by the member in question.  
After a consortium member is tagged in a proposals pull request and the consortium communication channel and that member does not respond within 3 months, their consortium membership becomes dormant, which means they do not count as consortium member in the context of deciding about any proposals.  
Dormant consortium members can reactivate themselves at any given time to become normal consortium members again unilateraly.
Consortium Members can end their consortium membership and remove themselves from the consortium membership list at any given time unilateraly.
