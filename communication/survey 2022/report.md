#Dat Ecosystem Survey

The survey for the Dat Ecosystem ran from 21st May to 9th June, and had 44 respondents.

Of the respondents it was indicated that the average age was under 35 years old, primarily English speaking with the majority from the US, with Germany close second. A primarily western demographic. (E-G)

The development focus was mostly JavaScript at around 65% with the remainder split between C / Rust, and Python respectively. There were a mix of other programming languages mentioned such as Go, Swift, Ruby, and Scala. (H-I)

Respondents were asked about the work they are doing, or for what industry. Answers were mixed, with most in website or software development, with a focus in the arts. (J)

The interest and perception of the Dat Ecosystem from the responses was seen as an alternative, independent platform, by nature decentralised and ownership of data of importance. Dat Ecosystem appears to be seen as a platform to build on top of, as a means of content delivery, storage and peer-to-peer file sharing. (K-L)

Respondents would generally like to see ease of use and sustainability, and of course tools built on top of the Ecosystem, along with tutorials and documentation for those getting started.

There is a strong sense for Dat Ecosystem to not be another vector for blockchain, cryptocurrency or NFTs.

Of the respondents, there is a greater familiarity with IPFS, but comparatively little for Dat Ecosystem.

When asked about the Dat Ecosystem Growth Program, the majority of 75 percent indicated that they would consider joining.

Additional questions were asked:

"Are there audits of the environmental impact of the protocol and ecosystem? If not, are you planning that?"

"Are we meeting up in Thailand later this year? (in Tulum, Mx with GF until September at this point... one room open if you want to come by!)"

"Do you have plans about a go implementation? Is there a list of apps built with DAT/Hyper?"

â€œARM platform support pls?"

"Why are you still called dat when the protocol has changed its name?"

"Will there be a DTN #3?! Can this please be in Berlin's Funkhaus again!?"
