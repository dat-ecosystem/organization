# DAT ecosystem organization

👋 Hello Friend!

The "Dat Ecosystem" is a project composed of people interested in things like the [hypercore-protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org).

We are organized around our [📜 Manifesto](./consortium/MANIFESTO.md), check it out if you want to know what, how and why we do things.

You can meet us at [🗓 Events](https://events.dat.foundation/), in the [💬 Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/fZymdRfctR), at [👥 Comm-Comm casual meetups](https://comm-comm.datproject.org/) or [💬 Cabal](https://github.com/dat-ecosystem/dat-ecosystem.github.io/blob/main/README.md#connect-to-cabal-with-cli-or-download-cabal-desktop).

If you meet us, please be aware that we follow a [📜 Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md).

We also publish things on our communal [🎥 Youtube Channel](https://https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbLY5Qg3t3OJbxZZUioqMOQ) or our communal [🐦 Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/dat_protocol).

If you would like to discuss any sensitive matter with the Consortium, please use [our private contact system](https://dat-ecosystem.org/organization).
