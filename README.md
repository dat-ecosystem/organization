# DAT ecosystem organization

👋 Hello Friend!

The "Dat Ecosystem" is a project composed of people interested in things like the [hypercore-protocol][1].

We are organized around our [📜 Manifesto][2], check it out if you want to know what, how and why we do things.

You can meet us at [🗓 Events][3], in the [💬 Discord Chat][4], at [👥 Comm-Comm casual meetups][5] or [💬 Cabal][6].

If you meet us, please be aware that we follow a [📜 Code of Conduct][7].

We also publish things on our communal [🎥 Youtube Channel][8] or our communal [🐦 Twitter Account][9].

If you would like to discuss any sensitive matter with the Consortium, please use [our private contact system][10].
